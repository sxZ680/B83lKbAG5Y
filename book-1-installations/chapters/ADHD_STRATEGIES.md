## The Inbox

> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them" - David Allen _The Getting Things Done Method_

The inbox is a place for you to store every question and idea so your brain is not overflowing with them until you shut down. Learning code inspires a lot of creative ideas, things you want to learn, and great questions. This is where you will keep a record of it all to process later.

### How to use it

1.  Grab a fresh notebook, notepad, a Goodnotes notebook on ipad, or an empty google docs document.
2.  Label it "Inbox"
3.  Set up a key. A great start is to have an icon for questions and an icon for ideas. You can use whatever works best for you.
4.  Every time a thought or a question comes to mind, record it as a bullet point with the correct icon.
5.  When an mentor comes to you for help, reference your inbox questions. Mark it as completed.
6.  At the end of the day, review your inbox. Strike through anything that is irrelevant.

#### Example:

| Icon           | Note           |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| !              | Idea           |
| ?              | Question       |
| ~~?~~ or ~~!~~ | Completed      |
|                | ~~Irrelevant~~ |

~~?~~ What's the difference between == and ===

? Why am I getting the error "cannot read properties of undefined"

! Look back through Book 2 - column 1 - chapter 3

! Practice writing for loops

? Why are some functions written differently

~~! Why am I behind everyone else on my team?~~

## The Daily Log

The daily log is where you keep track of your daily tasks as a running bullet list. Each list item _has_ to be _actionable_. This should be tracked in a fresh journal.

This is a technique taken from _The Bullet Journal Method_. Vist [the bullet journal website](https://bulletjournal.com/) to learn more.

X Fish Fusion chapter 4

X Fish Fusion 5

**_Not:_**

X Finish column 2

• Finish column 3

• Start Book 3

**_Suggestion:_** Review your Inbox at the start of each day. Add any actionable items from that list that you might want to tackle for the day.

If you don't complete all your tasks for the day, no problem! Migrate them to the next day.
This is what the end result will look like:

| Icon | Meaning        |
| ---- | -------------- |
| •    | Task           |
| X    | Completed Task |
| >    | Migrated Task  |

## Going Through the Course

Reading with ADHD can be incredibly difficult. You may find yourself reading the same thing over and over and over again but the words are just sounds in your head and you have no earthy idea what you just read.

Or you may be following requirements for an exercise. You start coding along but all of a sudden you're lost and have no idea if you missed a step of if you even understand the assignment at all. Here are some tips to get you through.

#### The Pomodoro technique

Using this method, you break your day into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 10 to 25 minutes. Find what time intervals work best for you.

Make sure you get up out of your chair and move around during your breaks. Looking at your phone is not a recommended break.

The app Focus Keeper is a great Pomodoro tool.

#### Using your Inbox

If the reason you are unable to read the course material is because you have so many thoughts and questions running through your mind, stop, jot it down in your inbox, and continue reading with a clear mind.

#### Reading aloud

If you are still reading that damn sentence for the seventh time, mute yourself and read it out loud. You might feel silly, but it works. Trust me.

#### Read THE WHOLE CHAPTER first before starting anything

This is very very important. When starting a new chapter, read the whole thing - before opening your terminal, cd-ing into workspace, writing a single line of code - read _everything_.

Then...

Go back and read it again. This time following along.

This way you don't miss anything and you understand all the requirements before you get started. You may feel like you're spending more time on each chapter by doing this but the reality is you are saving yourself time.

## Asking for help

Executive dysfunction is real. People deal with it everyday. And when it hits, shame and guilt hit as well. This can make you shy away from asking for help for fear of being "found out".

"Gosh, I have no idea what to do or how to fix this problem but everyone is ahead of me. If I ask for help from my mentors they're gonna know how far behind I am. Now I'm stuck, behind, and I can't ask for help because they'll kick me out for not doing anything."

1. We're not going to kick you out for asking for help.
2. We are _way_ more worried about you if you're not asking for help than if you're "behind"
3. You may not actually be "behind". Don't compare your pace to others'.
4. WE _WANT_ TO HELP YOU!!

So please, _please_, DO NOT let fear, shame, or guilt keep you from asking us for help. No one is going to find you out. You're already found out. We already know. But the good news is: we care.
